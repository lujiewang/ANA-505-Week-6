Support vector machines (SVMs) are a set of supervised learning methods used here for classification. SVM works by mapping data to a high-dimensional feature space so that data points can be categorized, even when the data are not otherwise linearly separable. A separator between the categories is found, then the data are transformed in such a way that the separator could be drawn as a hyperplane.
SVM accuracy: 97.33333 %

k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid), serving as a prototype of the cluster.
K-means clustering uses “centroids”, K different randomly-initiated points in the data, and assigns every data point to the nearest centroid. After every point has been assigned, the centroid is moved to the average of all of the points assigned to it. Here the k value eaqual to 3. Cause we have three categories.
K Means accuracy: 88.66667%

C50 is an R implementation of the supervised machine learning algorithm C5. 0 that can generate a decision tree. 
C50 accuracy: 86.66667% 

We can see from the accuracy result, SVM's performance is the best among the three models.
